// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input two numbers, call them A and b
use equation A + B = sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

    if sum divided by two is an integer, print EVEN
    else print ODD.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 

    input 5 different numbers, A, B, C, D, E    

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

    use equation A+B+C+D+E = sum

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.

 


d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

    Print the sum... The total of A+B+C+D+E = sum.
    Print the minimum ... the smallest number in the set is min.
    Print the maximum ... the largest number in the set is max.
