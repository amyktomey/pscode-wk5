// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input two numbers, call them a and b
use equation a + b = sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Input a number.
    if number divided by two is an integer, print EVEN
    else print ODD.

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers. 

    input 5 different numbers a,b,c,d,e.
    put them into an array... Call it 'Exercise3'.

b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

    get total of numbers in array: 
        total = sum(Exercise3)
    divide sum by 5 for average
        average = total/5 

c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
    search array for smallest number
        minimum = min(Exercise3) 
    search array for smallest number
        maximum = max(Exercise3) 



d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

    Print the average... The average of the numbers in the array = average.
    Print the minimum ... the smallest number in the array is minimum.
    Print the maximum ... the largest number in the array is maximum.
